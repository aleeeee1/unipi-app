# Download the app
You can download the app from [release page](https://github.com/UniPi-Orari/app/releases/latest)

# Building from source

### Android

```
flutter build apk
```

Yeah `flutter pub get` isn't really necessary, since it gets executed by `flutter build apk` anyway.

### iOS

You can generate an .ipa file by running:

```
build_ios.sh
```

You will need to be on a macOS machine with Xcode installed, logged in with a valid Team Account (which is not a Developer Account).

To install the app on your device, you can use the generated .ipa with [SideStore](https://github.com/SideStore) or whatever method you prefer.
